# Learning Object Metadata Crowd Tagging BB 

Learning Object Metadata Crowd Tagging is a system for tagging and reviewing learning objects such as videos, courses, and documents using a crowd of individuals. The goal is to make these learning objects more discoverable and searchable by adding relevant keywords, descriptions, reviews and other useful metadata. This process is carried out via the combination of a browser (Chrome) extension and a Learning Record Store (LRS) that allows multiple users to submit review and metadata edit proposals of learning objects. All the reviews and metadata edit proposals are sent in xAPI format and stored in an LRS to ensure data interoperability.
